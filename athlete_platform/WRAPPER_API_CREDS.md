# WRAPPER API CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT

##### Authored By: Andrew Prince on March 7th, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for securely managing user credentials required for wrapper APIs and web scrapers. Our primary goal is to enable functionality while ensuring that plain text credentials are never visible to our backend systems or administrators.

## Security Requirements

- Users must be able to provide credentials for third-party services
- Plain text credentials should never be transmitted to or stored on our servers
- Our system must never have access to user credentials in plain text
- The solution must be secure against both external attacks and internal threats
- Credentials must be available when needed for API operations

## Technical Strategy

### 1. Client-Side Encryption with Asymmetric Cryptography

- **Public-Private Key Architecture**: We implement an asymmetric encryption system.
  - Each user gets a unique key pair generated client-side
  - Private key remains exclusively on the user's device
  - Public key is sent to and stored on our servers

- **Credential Encryption Process**:
  - When a user enters credentials, they are encrypted with their public key in the browser
  - Only encrypted versions of credentials are transmitted to our servers
  - Only encrypted versions are stored in our database

### 2. Secure Key Management

- **Private Key Storage**:
  - Private keys are stored locally in the user's secure storage (localStorage with additional protection or, preferably, browser's built-in credential management API)
  - For added security, the private key can be encrypted with a user-provided passphrase

- **Key Rotation**:
  - Periodic key rotation is enforced to maintain security
  - When keys are rotated, all stored credentials are re-encrypted with the new keys

### 3. Authentication Flow

- **Initial Setup**:
  1. User generates key pair during account creation/setup
  2. Public key is registered with our service
  3. Private key remains on the client device

- **Adding Credentials**:
  1. User enters third-party credentials in their browser
  2. Credentials are encrypted with the user's public key
  3. Encrypted credentials are sent to our servers for storage

- **Using Credentials**:
  1. Encrypted credentials are retrieved from our database
  2. Sent to the user's client
  3. Decrypted locally using the private key
  4. Used for API calls directly from the client

### 4. Client-Side API Operations

- API operations requiring credentials execute on the client side when possible
- For operations requiring server resources, we use secure proxy techniques that keep credentials on the client

## Security Considerations

### Advantages Over Symmetric Encryption (AES)

Symmetric encryption would require our server to either:
1. Know the encryption key (security risk)
2. Store the key alongside the encrypted data (defeating the purpose)

Our asymmetric approach ensures that the decryption capability (private key) never exists on our servers.

### Potential Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

- **Loss of Private Key**: 
  - Implement a secure key recovery mechanism using additional encryption layers
  - Optionally allow secure escrow of recovery keys

- **Client-Side Security**:
  - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Regular security audits of client-side code
  - Protection against XSS attacks

- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**:
  - Always use HTTPS
  - Certificate pinning for API endpoints
  - Clear security indicators during credential entry

## Implementation Notes

- Use well-established cryptographic libraries (e.g., libsodium)
- Consider WebCrypto API for browser-based cryptographic operations
- Implement strict validation of all cryptographic operations
- Regular security audits of the entire system

## Future Enhancements

- Consider implementing a Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration option
- Explore zero-knowledge proof approaches for credential verification
- Investigate secure multi-party computation for operations that cannot be performed client-side
